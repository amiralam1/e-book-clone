                        It has been a pleasure working with Kevin Anderson and his team of talented writers and editors—I highly recommend them. Having collaborated together on over a dozen manuscripts since 2015, including the original Five Nights at Freddy’s series, I can attest to their responsiveness, dedication to excellence, and commitment to keeping their clients happy. The ability to work with multiple gifted writers concurrently has been especially valuable to me.

                        I really enjoy working with Kevin Anderson & Associates. They have a great team of writers and are very collaborative, responsive, and professional. Kevin’s team has been quick to provide a range of top-quality writers who they feel are ideal for the novels we want to have written. I am currently working with Kira Breed-Wrisley, a great writer and listener, and I have been so comfortable working with her.

                            <br><br>
                            Your editor will oversee the writing process and provide ongoing editorial review and direction to ensure the quality of the writing is up to publishing industry standards.

                                What Do I Need to Consider When Choosing a Ghostwriting Firm?
                            </button>

                            <div class="accordion-body">The Internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:
                                <br><br>

                                1. Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.<br><br>
                                2. Who owns the rights to the book? It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.<br><br>
                                3. What is the payment arrangement? You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.<br><br>
                                4. Who’s in charge? Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.<br><br>
                                5. Is the service confidential? This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.<br><br>
                                Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.

Every writer needs an editor, and even the most brilliant ideas can benefit from a collaborator or two. We can work with you on material that you’ve already created to give detailed, insightful feedback and suggestions on how to take your craft to the next level. We can also build off of the ideas that you’ve already generated and ghostwrite new material for you.

                                We know that the publishing industry can be daunting, especially for first-time authors, so we offer consultation and comprehensive support for traditional, hybrid, and self-publishing outlets. Most of our all-inclusive ghostwriting packages include an original and customized query letter or book proposal free of charge. This invaluable marketing tool will be used to promote your book to literary agents and publishers. Not sure how to find a reputable literary agent? We’ve got you covered—we’ll provide you with a list of genre-appropriate agents to whom you can send your query letter or proposal!

                                Our services are perfectly suited for writers who are looking to improve their work. Our professional staff is ready to give you the tools, motivation, and reflection that you need to succeed.

                            Every great book ever written was the result of an effective team. With KAA, you have an industry-leading team of bestselling writers, editors, and publishing executives that will develop a comprehensive strategy, navigate the publishing industry for you, and help you achieve your publishing goals.

                            <b>Your Book Editor</b>
                            Your editor will lead the book-writing process and collaborate with the team to (a) develop the book’s positioning, core concepts, structure, and themes; (b) provide market analysis and advise on target audience, marketing, and publishing strategy; (c) edit and review the manuscript throughout the book-writing process.

                            Note: All of the in-house editors at KAA are former acquisitions editors at Big-5 publishing houses (Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan, and Hachette) who have acquired and edited hundreds of traditionally published books, including numerous New York Times bestsellers.

                            <b> Ongoing Manuscript Review and Revisions</b>
                            Your writer will develop your manuscript one section at a time, giving you ample opportunity to discuss the draft in process and suggest revisions.
                            <br><br>
                            Your editor will oversee the writing process and provide ongoing editorial review and direction to ensure the quality of the writing is up to publishing industry standards.

                            <b>Finalize Your Draft </b>
                            Once the manuscript is complete and meets your full approval, an additional editor (who has no knowledge of the project) will perform a “cold read,” editing the text for grammar and providing a final round of analysis and consultation.

                                What Do I Need to Consider When Choosing a Ghostwriter?
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                        <div id="flush-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
                            <div class="accordion-body">The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:
                                <br><br>
                                1. Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.
                                <br><br>
                                2. Who owns the rights to the book? It’s your book, which means you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.
                                <br><br>
                                3. What is the payment arrangement? You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.
                                <br><br>
                                4. Who’s in charge? Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it will not be your book—it will be theirs.
                                <br><br>
                                5. Should I choose a freelancer or a firm? Beware of working with freelancers. While some may be reputable or qualified, most are overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you. Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and the writer, or a health concern), you will be stuck in the awkward and frustrating position of reclaiming your expenditures and then finding a replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the writer free of charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently and effectively.
                                <br><br>
                                6. What’s their reputation? Be sure the writer or firm has worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses. Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of bestselling writers, experienced editors, and a wide range of connections to literary agents and publishers.
                                <br><br>
                                Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable and experienced company.

Every writer needs an editor, and even the most brilliant ideas can benefit from a collaborator or two. We can work with you on material that you’ve already created to give detailed, insightful feedback and suggestions on how to take your craft to the next level. We can also build off of the ideas that you’ve already generated and ghostwrite new material for you.
                                <br><br>

                                We know that the publishing industry can be daunting, especially for first-time authors, so we offer consultation and comprehensive support for traditional, hybrid, and self-publishing outlets. Most of our all-inclusive ghostwriting packages include an original and customized query letter or book proposal free of charge. This invaluable marketing tool will be used to promote your book to literary agents and publishers. Not sure how to find a reputable literary agent? We’ve got you covered—we’ll provide you with a list of genre-appropriate agents to whom you can send your query letter or proposal!

                                Our services are perfectly suited for writers who are looking to improve their work. Our professional staff is ready to give you the tools, motivation, and reflection that you need to succeed.

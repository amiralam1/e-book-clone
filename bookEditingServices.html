                            <div class="accordion-body">Different levels of editing are like differently sized sieves; they are each designed to catch various problems, ranging from minor errors to major content issues.
                                <br><br>

                                1. Copy Editing and Proofreading<br>
                                This is the most basic form of editing and addresses only typos and objective grammatical errors. Only well-written manuscripts are ready for proofreading.<br><br>
                                2. Heavy editing<br>
                                For more in-depth review and revisions, heavy editing includes proofreading for grammar, as well as extensive revisions to improve diction, syntax, sentence structure, flow, style, tone, and transitions. Most manuscripts require heavy editing, though we can adjust our editing and pricing according to your manuscript’s condition.<br><br>
                                3. Critical review and analysis<br>
                                This service provides you with feedback and the opportunity to discuss your material with a writing expert. The editor will review and comment on your content and consult with you on how to best proceed with revisions and improvements.<br><br>
                                4. Developmental editing<br>
                                If you are looking for input on the creation of your content itself, developmental editing is a form of collaboration between author and editor in which the editor coaches the author through planning, writing, and revising their manuscript. Developmental editing addresses larger issues, such as the overarching themes and intention of the book, and includes broader suggestions and revisions to the structure, narrative, character development, voice, style, and pacing. It does not fully address spelling and grammar issues, as this is done significantly later in the process. Many first-time authors utilize a developmental editor to assist them throughout the writing process.<br><br>
                                5. Rewriting or ghostwriting<br>
                                Sometimes authors require help that goes beyond the scope of editing. In these cases, we offer options for rewriting or paraphrasing existing content, or ghostwriting original content. Our ghostwriting services can be utilized to develop an entire manuscript, or to add content and depth to an existing manuscript.

                                If you have a well-written manuscript that just requires final polishing, proofreading is likely the best option for you.<br><br>

                                Heavy editing is best for manuscripts that are early drafts, or those that were written quickly or by an inexperienced writer.<br><br>

                                If you are looking for feedback on the development of your material, critical review and analysis will provide you with in-depth input to help guide you in the writing process.<br><br>

                                For more collaborative consultation, developmental editing services will give you dedicated support as you develop your ideas—or your manuscript-in-progress—into a coherent, comprehensible book.<br><br>

                                If you need more extensive support with your content, we also offer rewriting and ghostwriting services to build off of existing material or generate new content.<br><br>

This method guarantees that you’ll be happy with the final result since you will have approved every page of writing leading up to the final page.

                        Working with Kevin Anderson & Associates has been a pleasure from start to finish—they even accommodated my request to meet with me in Japan. My lead editor, Mary, is a truly talented editor and a joy to work with. I couldn’t have been happier with our dynamic throughout the process. She brought a passion and an energy to my project that is rare to find and immensely valuable. I recommend KAA and look forward to collaborating on more projects in the future.

                        LifeSuccess has had the pleasure of working with Kevin and his team since early 2008. I must say that we’ve been very impressed with their professionalism and excellent editing services. Several of our authors have gone out of their way to express how much they’ve appreciated their professional advice and helpful insights. They have also been readily available to us whenever we’ve needed them in a crunch. I cannot recommend them enough.

Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:
                                <br><br>

                                1. Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.<br><br>
                                2. Who owns the rights to the book? It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.<br><br>
                                3. What is the payment arrangement? You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.<br><br>
                                4. Who’s in charge? Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.<br><br>
                                5. Is the service confidential? This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.<br><br>
                                Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.

                        I have worked with Kevin many times over the years for my memoir, book proposal, and articles. With each interaction, Kevin and his team provided excellent editorial services. His firm offers a diverse pool of editors to choose from, which enabled me to hone the type of service I was looking for. Each editor was concise and insightful, giving me constructive notes that really allowed me to take my work to the next level. I felt that they were in for the long haul because Kevin was always there for me when I had follow up questions. A great experience across the board.

                        The team at Kevin Anderson & Associates has been incredibly helpful in guiding me through the book-writing and publishing process, as well as building a great book proposal. Within two weeks of working together, Kevin landed me one of the top agents in the industry! Thank you for all your editorial support and assistance through this journey—it means a lot to have such committed partners on such an important project to me.

                        Pairing an author with the right ghostwriter is inherently fraught with built-in challenges, and these challenges cause risk for both the publisher and the author. Kevin Anderson & Associates reduces those risks by providing a layer of expertise and oversight on the entire process of selecting, coordinating, and managing the contract writing process. The end result is a better book because the right ghostwriter was chosen, the project was managed efficiently, and editorial quality was greatly increased. At HarperCollins Leadership we look forward to working with Kevin and his extensive team of writers and editors on another successful project as soon as possible.

                            <div class="accordion-body">There are many similarities between memoirs and autobiographies—both are nonfiction, factual accounts based on the author’s life, written in the first person—but the biggest difference is the timeframe that is covered in each genre.
                                <br><br>
                                Simply put, an autobiography tells the entire story of the author’s life, while a memoir tells a specific story from parts of the author’s life. A memoir might address a particular period of time or phase of life that holds significance, or events that are all related in some way. An autobiography generally covers all aspects of the author’s life up to the time it is written, though some experiences may be given more or less emphasis to convey the desired theme or overarching message.
                                <br><br>
                                When choosing whether to write a memoir or an autobiography, consider whether you would like to write your life story, from the beginning to the present day, or whether you would like to focus in on a particular period of time.

                            <div class="accordion-body">The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:
                                <br><br>
                                1. Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.<br><br>
                                2. Who owns the rights to the book? It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.<br><br>
                                3.What is the payment arrangement? You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.<br><br>
                                4. Who’s in charge? Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.<br><br>
                                5. Is the service confidential? This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.<br><br>
                                Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.

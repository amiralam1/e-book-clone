                        Pairing an author with the right ghostwriter is inherently fraught with built-in challenges, and these challenges cause risk for both the publisher and the author. Kevin Anderson & Associates reduces those risks by providing a layer of expertise and oversight on the entire process of selecting, coordinating, and managing the contract-writing process. The end result is a better book because the right ghostwriter was chosen, the project was managed efficiently, and editorial quality was greatly increased.

                        Working with Kevin Anderson & Associates has been a pleasure from start to finish—they even accommodated my request to meet with me in Japan. My lead editor, Mary, is a truly talented editor and a joy to work with. I couldn’t have been happier with our dynamic throughout the process. She brought a passion and an energy to my project that is rare to find and immensely valuable. I recommend KAA and look forward to collaborating on more projects in the future.

                            <b> Your Words. Your Voice. Our Pen.</b>
                            At KAA, we ensure that your book is unmistakably yours. Through ongoing interviews and careful editing, we’ll ensure every idea, word, and piece of content sounds and feels like your distinct voice.

                            <b> Ongoing Manuscript Review and Revisions</b>
                            Your writer will develop your manuscript one section at a time, giving you ample opportunity to discuss the draft in process and suggest revisions.
                            <br><br>
                            Your editor will oversee the writing process and provide ongoing editorial review and direction to ensure the quality of the writing is up to publishing industry standards.

                            <b>Finalize Your Draft </b>
                            Once the manuscript is complete and meets your full approval, an additional editor (who has no knowledge of the project) will perform a “cold read,” editing the text for grammar and providing a final round of analysis and consultation.

                                What Do I Need to Consider When Choosing a Book Ghostwriter?

                            <div class="accordion-body">The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:
                                <br><br>

                                1. Is the price right? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” or heavily discounted prices.
                                <br><br>
                                2. Who owns the rights to the book? It’s your book, which means you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.
                                <br><br>
                                3. What is the payment arrangement? You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.
                                <br><br>
                                4. Who’s in charge? Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it will not be your book—it will be theirs.
                                <br><br>
                                5. Should I choose a freelancer or a firm? Beware of working with freelancers. While some may be reputable or qualified, most are overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you. Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and the writer, or an unforeseen health concern), you will be stuck in the awkward and frustrating position of reclaiming your expenditures and then finding a replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the writer free of charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently and effectively.
                                <br><br>
                                6. What’s their reputation? Be sure the writer or firm has worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses. Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of bestselling writers, experienced editors with publishing experience, and deep connections to literary agents and publishers. You should be able to look at a writer’s client list and see names you recognize. There should be some New York Times, USA Today, or Wall Street Journal bestsellers on their list (beware of “Amazon” bestsellers, which are easy for anyone to rig). And don’t fall for this line: “Since I’m a ghostwriter, I can’t share any titles due to confidentiality.” While most ghostwriting relationships with clients may be confidential, any experienced writer will have some industry credits and secured acknowledgements. If a ghostwriter can’t share any of their clients or work, then they probably don’t have much to show.
                                <br><br>
                                Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable and experienced company.
